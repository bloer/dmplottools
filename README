README for dmplottools

These tools are used to create plots about dark matter interactions with 
common detector materials, and standard exclusion plots. The files are ROOT
macros, and should be run like
 > root macro.C

The macros that would normally be invoked are:

- PlotVdist.C: Plot the average WIMP velocity distribution in the lab frame
- PlotRecoilSpectrum.C: Plot the differential spectrum of nuclear recoils 
  			generated by WIMP interactions
- PlotIntegralRate.C: Plot the total WIMP-induced nuclear recoil rate above 
  		      threshold as a function of threshold energy
- PlotModulationAmplitude.C: Plot the annual modulation of the rate of 
  			     WIMP-induced nuclear recoils as a fraction
			     of the total recoil rate above threshold
- PlotExclusionLimits.C: As it stands, this plots the WIMP-nucleon cross 
     section sensitivity as a function of WIMP mass for an ideal DarkSide-50
     detector, using the TRolke method. It can be modified to use other 
     calculations, as well as other isotopes and masses. It also includes
     out-of-date limits from CDMS, XENON, CoGeNT and DAMA.


Plot Variables:
Adjusting the labels, masses, etc. requires directly editing the relevant macro.
However, parameters about the WIMP mass and velocity distribution can be 
edited in the StandardVars.C macro, which is referenced by all the other macros.
